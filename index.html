    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_100_100/AAEAAQAAAAAAAArDAAAAJDc3MDhiMDg4LTZmMDMtNDI5ZC1hYTQ4LTk0ODY3YTQ5OWU5MA.jpg" alt="Tom's Picture">
    <p>
      My name is Thomas Ryan. I'm a Hyperion database developer/administrator located
      in Woodridge a suburb of Chicago. I enjoy baking and cooking and practice kick boxing and tai chi.
      I'm also pretty good at tennis and japanese chess (shogi)
    </p>
    <h1>My Background</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a graduate of the Naval Nuclear Power program.
      I started in the computer field during Y2K editing COBOL on
      mainframes, after that I moved over to databases specializing
      in Oracle, and next I started developing and administrating
      in Hyperion.
    </p>
    <h1>Why I'm learning to Program</h1>
    <p>
      I've done just about everything in the electrical field:
      Power generation in the Navy, Construction Electrical,
      Electronics Technician, and finally Computer Programming.
      I have to say, I find the computer work to be the most fulfilling.
      I enjoy solving business problems using technology, primarily using
      databases, but now I want to be able to use full stack technology.
